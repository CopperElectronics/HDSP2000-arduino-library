# HDSP2000-arduino-library
Library for controlling the HDSP2000 display on Arduino. It is based on interrupts, so you can use delays like delay(), although it's better to use millis(). The library is not perfect, pixels slightly darken when too many of them are lit either across the entire display or in a particular column.
